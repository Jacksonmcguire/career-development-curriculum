# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template when conducting DTR with your project partners. *It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation.* 

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
Implementing what we have learned in class into a project, driven to take the knowledge we have learned thus far and put it into practice.
* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
Kind of hard to determine right now hoping to find out through this project, excited to have another pair of eyes looking at the code.
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
Created calendar, talked about timeline, keep in touch through slack throughout the project.
* How would you describe your work style?
Bringing our strengths together to accomplish our goals.
* What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
Come back later if answer found, otherwise not really relevant.
* What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
Communicating well and shared work load or even distribution of work, lack of communication can lead to poor work. 
* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
Through communication and open discussion about what makes the most sense going forward.
* How will we overcome obstacles?
Leaning on outside resources and referring to past exercises as well as taking breaks.
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
Communication, environment where your opinion and open discussion is valued.
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
Figured out ourselves through calendars.
* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
Give feedback throughout the project as we go, not worried about being held back from giving feedback.
* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
COME BACK
* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
Slack, github, tuple
* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
Communicate and determine the best course of action.
* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
Checking the rubric often to make sure all of our goals are met.
* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
Celebrating small wins and appreciating each others positivity and using those small wins as motivation to get past the next problem.

Any additional questions that you would like to add:

### Remote Work Considerations During the COVID-19 Quarantine
* What does remote focus look like for you? (headphones, distractions minimized (tv, family stuff, etc), video on)
* When working from the same place where you live, life can get in the way. What are some potential life things that could affect your ability to focus, and what plan can we come up with to approach those moments? 
* If we encounter issues such as power outages, Zoom difficulties, or bad wifi, what backup plans can we have in place? (This could have answers like  asking a neighbor to borrow wifi, using cellphone hotspot for internet, switching to slack or skype. 
* Pomodoro breaks are especially important for remote work and doubly so for quarantine. What should our Pom cadence look like? How will hold ourselves accountable?
* Quarantine is tough, so it’s important to make note of our mental/emotional state when working with others. How can we make space to check in on each other’s well being, in addition to the work that needs to be done?
